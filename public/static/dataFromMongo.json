No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.' More than two centuries have passed since Johnson's era, but his words still ring true. Life in London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers find that one visit isn't enough to experience everything this two-millennia-old city has to offer.","src":"/img/london.png"},{"location":"Bora Bora","description":"The small island of Bora Bora (just about 6 miles long and a little more than 2 miles wide) overflows with beauty. A dormant volcano rises up at its center and fans out into lush jungle before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote 'Tales of the South Pacific,' called Bora Bora 'the most beautiful island in the world.' The 18th-century British explorer James Cook even coined it as the 'Pearl of the Pacific.' The very definition of a tropical getaway, blissful Bora Bora abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters and friendly locals.","src":"/img/bora.png"},{"location":"Glacier National Park","description":"Named for the remnants of glaciers from the ice age, Glacier National Park is located on the border of Canada and the United States and is often called the 'Crown of the Continent' since it sits at the headwaters of the streams that flow into the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay. A favorite among hikers, the park features a variety of trails for all skill levels, ranging from the easy Trail of the Cedars to the challenging Grinnell Glacier. What's more, the park boasts more than 700 lakes, numerous waterfalls and two mountain ranges, spread across more than 1 million acres that shelter an array of wildlife.

For many Hawaii vacationers, Maui is just right â€“ offering a taste of just about everything the Aloha State has to offer, from impressive wildlife to intriguing history and culture. While on a visit here, you can shimmy alongside professional hula dancers, golf along coastal fairways, sail down a zip line, snorkel alongside five different types of sea turtles or simply lounge along some of Hawaii's most notable beaches.","src":"/img/maui.png"}]
